# Little-SAS-Book-Exercises-And-Projects

SAS programs created based on exercises in The Little SAS Book.  SAS programs are either a program written as part of a programming exercise, or a program written to answer a multiple choice question.

I created this GitHub repository as a way to save and share code I wrote while learning SAS and working through The Little SAS Book: Exercises and Projects.  
If you are learning SAS and working though this book then maybe some of my solutions will help if you get stuck on a problem.  
But, like learning any new skill make sure you at least spend some time struggling with a problem that you do not understand, or re-read portions of The Little SAS Book that the problems test.
You never know what you might learn and end up understanding better!
